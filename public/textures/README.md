# Textures Directory

This directory contains texture files used in the application's 3D models. 

Current textures:
- womb-texture.jpg: A texture used for the womb model in the fetus 3D visualization.

Note: In production, you would replace these placeholder files with high-quality textures optimized for web delivery.

## Soothing Visual Elements

For the pregnancy app UI, we use:
- Calming pastel colors
- Soft gradients and patterns
- Subtle animations
- Visually comforting designs

These elements are designed to reduce stress and provide emotional support for pregnant users.
